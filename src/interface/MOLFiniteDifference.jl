A discretization algorithm.

## Arguments

- `dxs`: A vector of pairs of parameters to the grid step in this dimension, i.e. `[x=>0.2, y=>0.1]`.
    For a non-uniform rectilinear grid, replace any or all of the step sizes with the grid you'd like to
    use with that variable, must be an `AbstractVector` but not a `StepRangeLen`.
- `time`: Your choice of continuous variable, usually time. If `time = nothing`, then discretization
    yields a `NonlinearProblem`. Defaults to `nothing`.

## Keyword Arguments

- `approx_order`: The order of the derivative approximation.
- `advection_scheme`: The scheme to be used to discretize advection terms, i.e. first order spatial derivatives and associated coefficients. Defaults to `UpwindScheme()`. WENOScheme() is also available, and is more stable and accurate at the cost of complexity.
- `grid_align`: The grid alignment types. See [`CenterAlignedGrid()`](@ref) and [`EdgeAlignedGrid()`](@ref).
- `use_ODAE`: If `true`, the discretization will use the `ODAEproblem` constructor.
    Defaults to `false`.
- `kwargs`: Any other keyword arguments you want to pass to the `ODEProblem`.
