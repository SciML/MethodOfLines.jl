`cartesian_nonlinear_laplacian`

Differential(x)(expr(x)*Differential(x)(u(x)))

Given an internal multiplying expression `expr`, return the correct finite difference equation for the nonlinear laplacian at the location in the grid given by `II`.

The inner derivative is discretized with the half offset centered scheme, giving the derivative at interpolated grid points offset by dx/2 from the regular grid.

The outer derivative is discretized with the centered scheme, giving the nonlinear laplacian at the grid point `II`.
For first order returns something like this:
`d/dx( a du/dx ) ~ (a(x+1/2) * (u[i+1] - u[i]) - a(x-1/2) * (u[i] - u[i-1]) / dx^2`

For 4th order, returns something like this:
```
first_finite_diffs = [a(x-3/2)*finitediff(u, i-3/2),
                      a(x-1/2)*finitediff(u, i-1/2),
                      a(x+1/2)*finitediff(u, i+1/2),
                      a(x+3/2)*finitediff(u, i+3/2)]

dot(central_finite_diff_weights, first_finite_diffs)
```

where `finitediff(u, i)` is the finite difference at the interpolated point `i` in the grid.

And so on.

"""
`generate_finite_difference_rules`

Generate a vector of finite difference rules to dictate what to replace variables in the `pde` with at the gridpoint `II`.

Care is taken to make sure that the rules only use points that are actually in the discretized grid by progressively up/downwinding the stencils when the gridpoint `II` is close to the boundary.

There is a genral catch all ruleset that uses the cartesian centered difference scheme for derivatives, and simply the discretized variable at the given gridpoint for particular variables.

There are of course more specific schemes that are used to improve stability/speed/accuracy when particular forms are encountered in the PDE. These rules are applied first to override the general ruleset.

##Currently implemented special cases are as follows:
    - Spherical derivatives
    - Nonlinear laplacian uses a half offset centered scheme for the inner derivative to improve stability
    - Spherical nonlinear laplacian.
    - Up/Downwind schemes to be used for odd ordered derivatives multiplied by a coefficient, downwinding when the coefficient is positive, and upwinding when the coefficient is negative.

Please submit an issue if you know of any special cases which impact stability or accuracy that are not implemented, with links to papers and/or code that demonstrates the special case.
