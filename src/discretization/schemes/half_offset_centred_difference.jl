"""
Get the weights and stencil for the inner half offset centered difference for the nonlinear laplacian for a given index and differentiating variable.

Does not discretize so that the weights can be used in a replacement rule
TODO: consider refactoring this to harmonize with centered difference

Each index corresponds to the weights and index for the derivative at index i+1/2
