# `cartesian_nonlinear_laplacian`

Differential(x)(expr(x)*Differential(x)(u(x)))

Given an internal multiplying expression `expr`, return the correct finite difference equation for the nonlinear laplacian at the location in the grid given by `II`.

The inner derivative is discretized with the half offset centered scheme, giving the derivative at interpolated grid points offset by dx/2 from the regular grid.

The outer derivative is discretized with the centered scheme, giving the nonlinear laplacian at the grid point `II`.
For first order returns something like this:
`d/dx( a du/dx ) ~ (a(x+1/2) * (u[i+1] - u[i]) - a(x-1/2) * (u[i] - u[i-1]) / dx^2`

For 4th order, returns something like this:
```
first_finite_diffs = [a(x-3/2)*finitediff(u, i-3/2),
                      a(x-1/2)*finitediff(u, i-1/2),
                      a(x+1/2)*finitediff(u, i+1/2),
                      a(x+3/2)*finitediff(u, i+3/2)]

dot(central_finite_diff_weights, first_finite_diffs)
```

where `finitediff(u, i)` is the finite difference at the interpolated point `i` in the grid.

And so on.
