# Schrödinger Equation

MethodOfLines can solve linear complex PDEs like the Scrödinger equation:

```@example schro
using MethodOfLines, OrdinaryDiffEq, Plots, DomainSets, ModelingToolkit

@parameters t, x
@variables ψ(..)

Dt = Differential(t)
Dxx = Differential(x)^2

xmin = 0
xmax = 1

V(x) = 0.0

eq = [im * Dt(ψ(t, x)) ~ Dxx(ψ(t, x)) + V(x) * ψ(t, x)] # You must enclose complex equations in a vector, even if there is only one equation

ψ0 = x -> ((1 + im)/sqrt(2))*sinpi(2*x)

bcs = [ψ(0, x) => ψ0(x), # Initial condition must be marked with a => operator
    ψ(t, xmin) ~ 0,
    ψ(t, xmax) ~ 0]

domains = [t ∈ Interval(0, 1), x ∈ Interval(xmin, xmax)]

@named sys = PDESystem(eq, bcs, domains, [t, x], [ψ(t, x)])

disc = MOLFiniteDifference([x => 100], t)

prob = discretize(sys, disc)

sol = solve(prob, TRBDF2(), saveat = 0.01)

discx = sol[x]
disct = sol[t]

discψ = sol[ψ(t, x)]
anim = @animate for i in 1:length(disct)
    u = discψ[i, :]
    plot(discx, [real.(u), imag.(u)], ylim = (-1.5, 1.5), title = "t = $(disct[i])",
        xlabel = "x", ylabel = "ψ(t,x)", label = ["re(ψ)" "im(ψ)"], legend = :topleft)
end

```

Note that complex initial conditions are supported, but must be marked with a `=>` operator.

This represents the second from ground state of a particle in an infinite quantum well, try changing the potential `V(x)`, initial conditions and BCs, it is extremely interesting to see how the wave function evolves even for nonphysical combinations. Be sure to post interesting results on the discourse!
