Where `dxs` is a vector of pairs of parameters to the grid step in this dimension, i.e. `[x=>0.2, y=>0.1]`

Note that the second argument to `MOLFiniteDifference` is optional, all parameters can be discretized if all required boundary conditions are specified.

Currently supported grid types: `center_align` and `edge_align`. Edge align will give better accuracy with Neumann boundary conditions.

`center_align`: naive grid, starting from lower boundary, ending on upper boundary with step of `dx`

`edge_align`: offset grid, set halfway between the points that would be generated with center_align, with extra points at either end that are above and below the supremum and infimum by `dx/2`. This improves accuracy for Neumann BCs.
