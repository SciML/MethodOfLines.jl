# Staggered Grids

For more examples of staggered grid implementations for the wave equation, see the tests `/test/pde_systems/wave_eq_staggered.jl`

Hyperbolic PDEs are often most written as a system of first-order equations. When the original system is of second-order (e.g., wave equation), this results in a natural splitting of variables as demonstrated below. Staggered-grid numerical schemes have been developed for such equations as efficient and conservative finite difference schemes.

To utilize this functionality, only two differences are needed to the user-interface. `grid_align=MethodOfLines.StaggeredGrid()` and defining which variable is edge aligned (vs center aligned), `edge_aligned_var=ϕ(t,x)`

Solvers should be chosen carefully, the only officially supported solver is `SplitEuler`, but in theory any SSP solver could be used.

Staggered grid functionality is still in its infancy. Please open issues if unexpected results occur or needed functionality is not present.

bcs = [ρ(0,x) ~ initialFunction(x),
       ϕ(0.0,x) ~ 0.0,
       ρ(t,L) ~ ρ(t,-L),
       ϕ(t,-L) ~ ϕ(t,L)];

domains = [t in Interval(0.0, tmax),
           x in Interval(-L, L)];

@named pdesys = PDESystem(eq, bcs, domains, [t,x], [ρ(t,x), ϕ(t,x)]);

discretization = MOLFiniteDifference([x=>dx], t, grid_align=MethodOfLines.StaggeredGrid(), edge_aligned_var=ϕ(t,x));
prob = discretize(pdesys, discretization);

sol = solve(prob, SplitEuler(), dt=dt);
